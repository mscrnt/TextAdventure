## Overview

This document serves as a guide for expanding the game world in 'Odyssey'. The world is structured in JSON format, comprising locations, sublocations, items, NPCs, and other interactive elements.

## Adding Locations

### Structure

```json
{

    "description": "Description of the location.",
    "main-entry": true or false,
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "paths": {
        "direction": "Connected Location or Sublocation",
        "room_direction": "Room within the current location"
    },
    "sublocations": [
        // Sublocation objects
    ]
}
```

### Instructions

- **name**: A string representing the location's name.
- **description**: A brief description of the location.
- **main-entry**: Boolean indicating if the location is the main entry point for the game.
- **keywords**: An array of strings that are key themes or elements of the location.
- **paths**: An object where each key is a direction or a descriptor (e.g., "north", "up", "entrance to X") and each value is the name of the location it connects to, which can be a top-level location, sublocation, or a room within the current location.
- **sublocations**: An array of sublocation objects.

## Adding Sublocations

### Structure

```json
{
    "name": "Sublocation Name",
    "description": "Description of the sublocation.",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "paths": {
        "exit": "Parent Location",

    },
    "items": [
        // Item objects
    ],

        // Container objects
    ],
    "npcs": [
        // NPC objects
    ],
    "rooms": [
        // Room objects
    ]
}
```
## Adding Rooms

Rooms are specialized sublocations that exist within the hierarchy of a sublocation. They represent distinct areas players can explore and interact with.

### Structure

```json
{
    "name": "Room Name",
    "description": "Description of the room.",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "visible": true or false,
    "paths": {
        "entrance": "Parent Sublocation",
        "exit": "Connecting Room or Sublocation"
    },
    "items": [
        // Item objects
    ],
    "npcs": [
        // NPC objects
    ]
}
```

### Instructions

- **name**: A string representing the room's name.
- **description**: A description of the room's atmosphere, features, and any lore-related elements.
- **keywords**: Key terms associated with the room.
- **visible**: Boolean indicating if the room is visible to the player. If set to `false`, the room will be hidden until the player triggers an event that reveals it.
- **paths**: Directions leading into and out of the room. The "entrance" key leads back to the parent sublocation, while "exit" can lead to another room or back to the sublocation.
- **items**: Items that can be found or interacted with in the room.
- **npcs**: NPCs present within the room, each with their dialogue and interactions.

Remember, when specifying paths for rooms, ensure that they are consistent with the rest of the world's navigation structure. This will enable players to move seamlessly between locations, sublocations, and rooms.
